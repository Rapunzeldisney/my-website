            <h2>My Interests/ Hobbies</h2>
            <p>In addition to my academic background, I have some interests:</p>
            <div class="hobby">
                <img src="images/image.jpg" alt="drawing and painting">
            <p> At a young age, my interest for drawing and painting showed. It evolved into one of my most gratifying pursuits over time. Capturing a person's emotion or expression on paper is something deeply satisfying.
                Each piece tells a story through my creations. A passion resides in me, cooking, alongside my inclination to sketch. Cooking, to my belief, is just a distinct craft; flavors melting together to conjure something exquisite and substantial.
                Different visual art varieties attracts me. It is a tool to express myself. Whenever I feel happy, sad, angry, or whatever my mood is, I feel like drawing diverts my mind from that things and I feel good after that.
                It doesn't matter the scenario—painting big surfaces or scribbling on little books—in any form of art, a calming and satisfying feeling fills my being with innovation.</p>
            <p> All forms of art are my self-expression and world connection. My belief stands that creativity is a potent instrument for personal expression and connection.</p>
