            <h2>Academic Experiences</h2>
            <p> I completed my academic journey in the <span class="highlight">Science stream</span>, with a strong focus on Biology and Mathematics. These subjects have honed my analytical thinking and problem-solving skills, which now serve as a solid foundation for my journey into the world of Information Technology. 
                Although I have only recently started exploring the realm of computing, my passion for understanding how technology intersects with science has fueled my curiosity. 
                This academic experience, coupled with my interest in creative problem-solving, has inspired me to embark on this new path toward IT.</p>

            <h2>How did I get into Computing?</h2>
             <p>Whenever I looked at my phone to get some information, or using a social media or to play. I always thought, how is it possible like how does the internet works? How do I get all the information that I want to know in just a few seconds?
                How does my phone work? What's the meaning of network? How can I make the websites just like I saw on the internet??- I had so many questions, I want to know all about how the technology works in our life and how is it making our life so easier??- 
                what's the tech side of computing? In the beginning, it felt like climbing a mountain so tall that it reached the sky, leaving me feeling hopeless. But as I kept facing that fear, I gradually uncovered its true nature.</p>

             <p>Yes, I began to see it as similar to an artist struggling with a challenging new technique. My journey started with choosing to study a Bachelor of Information Technology.
                The technical component's overwhelming sensation was experienced initially, but as time rolled forward and practice was done, I started to get a hang of that.
                It required so much repeated practice and experimentation. Every error became a learning moment; I had learned quickly. Keeping this mentality close to my heart, it acted as a fire of motivation, always burning within, always driving me forward, even when the journey was tough.
                Making a simple webpage is my first creation. It lacked complexity; however, witnessing an animated image on screen due to coded lines, it was full of immense satisfaction.</p>
                
             <p>I'm excited about expanding my knowledge, even though I don't have traditional work experience or computing-related projects. Just like the satisfaction I get from finishing a piece of art, the tech learning process also gives me a sense of accomplishment. 
                The challenges that come up along the way are like an adventure, helping me grow and improve my skills.</p>
